Hi Friends/Colleagues!

With the coronavirus rapidly spreading, I am joining with others in encouraging everyone to bow gently instead of shaking hands when greeting each other.  See www.BowDontShake.org .   Will you join us?  Please forward and share this message to everyone you know.

Be safe.  Be responsible.  #BowDontShake  

Thanks!
