Hi Friends/Colleagues!

With the coronavirus rapidly spreading, I am joining with others in encouraging everyone to bow gently instead of shaking hands when greeting each other.  See www.BowDontShake.org  Will you join us?  Please forward and share this message to everyone you know.

Be safe.  Be responsible.  #BowDontShake  

Thanks!
