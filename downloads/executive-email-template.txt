Hi INSERT_NAME,

With the coronavirus rapidly spreading, we can take one very simple step to reduce disease transmission: Bow, Don't Shake.
Instead of greeting each other with a handshake, give a brief, gentle bow.

Can you please post this simple public health message in workplaces and other gathering places, and on websites?  The www.BowDontShake.org website has ready-made graphics and other downloadables that anyone may freely copy and use.

Please also reach out to other officials and administrators that you know, to similarly share this message in their organizations.

Be safe.  Be responsible.  #BowDontShake  

Thanks!
