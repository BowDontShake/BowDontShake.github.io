# Source code -- Bow, Don't Shake!

The code in this directory is OBSOLETE!  I have changed to using
a google spreadsheet:

This directory contains source code used to help with
COVID-19 data analysis.  The raw data is pulled from
a Johns-Hopkins github repo at https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 .

Files:

- update-usa-totals.bash -- Bash script to update USA COVID-19 totals based on pulling the Johns-Hopkins github data.
- total-usa.perl -- Invoked by update-usa-totals.bash to re-generate ../covid-19-usa-totals.csv
